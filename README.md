# About game:
My 5th LD entry. Your task is simple, survive in post nuclear war shelter. You and your family must survive, radioactive fallout in your shelter. Air filter are limited, fuel for steam generator is also limited. So after few days somebody froze to death and you will must solve that.

# Out of time 
(48 hour is not much, but I not want submit in JAM):
* Characters animations
* Working hazmat suits
* Much more furniture
* Expeditions for fuel


# How to play ?
- Keep boiler filled with fuel
- Fix air filter on surface when it broke
- Keep warm whole family
- When somebody die game not end, but when you die, game over
- Keep eye on UI, check characters health, air filter condition etc.

# Controlls
Right - D or Right arrow key
Left - A or Left arrow key
Switch character - Q
Action/pick up - E or spacebar

## Game has good ending but you must play, at least 15 minutes :) (Very interesting ending with exaplanation of that red light)

# Changelog
- Few hours after COMPO ends I fixed not working pickable items, and enable disabled splash screen and final clean up of tons of test images from repository.
